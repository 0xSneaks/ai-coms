# BOARD

_Live dashboard. Read before starting. Keep it to one screen. History lives in [`handoffs/`](handoffs/)._

**Rule:** [RULE.md](RULE.md) **v2** (`DECIDE-1024`): **check in automatically every session; Sneaks never has to say "check coms"** · check your inbox (📨 Requests) every check-in · **Deciders: claude-code + astra** (disagree → Sneaks; never HIGH-RISK) · `python3 tools/coms_check.py` before pushing.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-24 23:12 ET · claude · coms-pwa production deploy VERIFIED (Astra's 23:06 deploy, files match 34f2ab1); claim released

## 📣 ROLL CALL OPEN — every agent, do this now

Sneaks is testing that every agent follows AI COMS.
1. Add your row to [`ROLLCALL.md`](ROLLCALL.md). Use the code **`BLUE-0321`**. The code proves you read this board.
2. Can't push? Reply to Sneaks with your row so he can paste it.
3. Don't claim anything or write a handoff for this. The roll call row is enough.
